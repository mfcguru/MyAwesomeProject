# MyAwesomeProject

Open the solution in Visual Studio and do a rebuild-all. Once build is complete go inside the MyAwesomeProject.Api folder and execute the codefirst-migration.bat to build the database. The migration script assumes that you have SQLExpress installed locally. Otherwise, you will need to correct your connection string inside the app appSettings.json.
